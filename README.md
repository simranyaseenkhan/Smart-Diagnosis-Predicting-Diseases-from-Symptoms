??? Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

?? Overview
This project is a Machine Learning-based Disease Prediction System that helps in identifying potential diseases based on input symptoms. It leverages Multinomial Naïve Bayes, a probabilistic algorithm known for its efficiency in text-based classifications.
?? Features
? Predicts diseases based on symptoms
? Uses Multinomial Naïve Bayes for high accuracy
? Pre-trained on a dataset of diseases and symptoms
? Lightweight and fast execution
? Scalable and easy to integrate with web applications
