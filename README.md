# 🌡️ Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

## 🚀 Overview  

This project is a **Machine Learning-based Disease Prediction System** that helps in identifying potential diseases based on input symptoms. It leverages **Multinomial Naïve Bayes**, a probabilistic algorithm known for its efficiency in text-based classifications.  

## 🎯 Features  

✅ Predicts diseases based on symptoms  
✅ Uses **Multinomial Naïve Bayes** for high accuracy  
✅ Pre-trained on a dataset of diseases and symptoms  
✅ Lightweight and fast execution  
✅ Scalable and easy to integrate with web applications
